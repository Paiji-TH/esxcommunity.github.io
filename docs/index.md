# Welcome to the <br/> <b>unofficial</b> ESX documentation!

For the official documentation please visit [esx-org.github.io](https://esx-org.github.io/).

## Community managed
This documentation is managed by the ESX community. The community decided to create their own documentation because the [offical one](https://esx-org.github.io/) hasn't been updated in months and pull requests are ignored. If you want to improve any page, please do so, we welcome everyone to be a part of the documentation.

Our intention is not to step on anyones toes, we really appreciate the work of the ESX team. Our goal with this page is to offer a good documentation that could help a lot of people. 

## Credits
A lot of the documentation are copied from the [offical one](https://esx-org.github.io/). Even if most of it are empty pages we would like to give the original authors some credits.

## Contribution
On every page there's a pen icon on the right side of the page title. By clicking that you'll be taken to the github repo for that page. You'll then need to fork our repo and make your changes. Make sure you're using the branch "docs" as the master branch hosts the website. 

We're using something called Mkdocs because the [offical](https://esx-org.github.io/) documentation uses it and we want to make it as similiar as possible. By using Mkdocs we need to re-generate the website with the new content. That's why we can't update the docs every day. 

We will update the docs..

- If there are 5 or more pull requests
- Every sunday if there are any pull requests
